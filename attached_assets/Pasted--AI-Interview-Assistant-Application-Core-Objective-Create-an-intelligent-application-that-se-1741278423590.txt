# AI Interview Assistant Application

## Core Objective
Create an intelligent application that seamlessly integrates with popular meeting platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) to provide real-time interview assistance. The application should identify speakers, distinguish between interviewer and interviewee, analyze questions in real-time, and suggest optimal responses to the interviewee through a discreet interface.

## Technical Requirements

### Meeting Platform Integration
- Implement API integrations with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams
- Create stable WebRTC connections to capture audio/video streams
- Develop fallback methods for platforms without direct API access (browser extensions, desktop agents)
- Handle authentication flows securely for each platform

### Speaker Identification
- Implement voice fingerprinting algorithms to distinguish between multiple speakers
- Create a role classification system to identify:
  - Primary interviewer(s)
  - Secondary interviewer(s)
  - Interviewee
  - Other participants
- Train models to recognize speaker transitions and interruptions
- Maintain speaker profiles throughout the session even with poor audio quality

### Speech Recognition & Processing
- Implement real-time speech-to-text with <98% accuracy for professional vocabulary
- Build domain-specific language models for technical interviews
- Create noise cancellation and audio enhancement preprocessing
- Develop latency optimization to provide suggestions within 1-2 seconds
- Support multiple languages and accents with automatic detection

### Question Analysis & Response Generation
- Design an interview question classifier with categories:
  - Technical knowledge assessment
  - Behavioral/situational assessment
  - Experience verification
  - Hypothetical scenarios
  - Culture fit evaluation
- Implement context-aware response generation based on:
  - Previously discussed topics in the current interview
  - Common industry best practices
  - Customizable response styles (concise, detailed, technical, etc.)
- Create suggestion filtering to avoid inappropriate or dishonest responses
- Develop a confidence scoring system for generated responses

### User Interface
- Create a minimal, non-intrusive overlay that won't be visible to interviewers
- Design keyboard shortcuts for navigating suggestions
- Implement adjustable transparency and position settings
- Develop a mode to display only keywords/concepts rather than full responses
- Create visual indicators for response confidence levels
- Add screenshot protection to prevent detection

### User Customization & Preparation
- Allow users to upload resume and job description for personalized responses
- Enable configuration of expertise level across different domains
- Provide pre-interview training mode to customize the system to user's voice
- Allow creation of prepared responses for anticipated questions
- Support custom terminology and technical vocabulary

### Data Security & Privacy
- Implement end-to-end encryption for all audio/video processing
- Create strict data retention policies with immediate post-session purging
- Design offline processing capabilities for sensitive information
- Develop detailed consent and privacy notifications
- Include emergency purge functionality

### Performance Optimization
- Design efficient resource usage to run alongside video conferencing apps
- Implement selective processing to handle resource constraints
- Create backup modes for low-bandwidth situations
- Develop lightweight models for devices with limited processing power

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Build speech recognition and basic speaker identification
- Implement question classification system
- Create simple response generation
- Develop minimal user interface

### Phase 2: Platform Integration
- Add Zoom API integration
- Extend to Google Meet
- Implement Microsoft Teams compatibility
- Create universal fallback capture method

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Enhance speaker identification accuracy
- Improve context awareness in responses
- Add customization options
- Implement security features

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
- Optimize performance across devices
- Refine user interface
- Conduct extensive testing across platforms
- Implement feedback mechanisms

## Ethical Considerations
The application should:
- Include clear guidelines on ethical usage
- Avoid enabling dishonest representations of skills or experience
- Focus on helping users present their actual knowledge effectively
- Include disclaimers about appropriate use cases
- Provide alternatives like "I'd need to research that further" for unknown topics

## Technical Stack Recommendations
- Frontend: React with Electron for desktop capabilities
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- ML Processing: TensorFlow.js for client-side processing
- Speech Recognition: Mozilla DeepSpeech or similar open-source solution
- Cloud Services: Firebase for authentication, optional cloud processing
- Database: IndexedDB for local storage, Firestore for optional cloud backup

## Success Metrics
- Speaker identification accuracy >95%
- Question classification accuracy >90%
- Response generation latency <2 seconds
- User-reported helpfulness score >4.5/5
- Session completion rate >98%
